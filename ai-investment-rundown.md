# AI Investment Landscape: ETF & Index Fund Rundown

*Compiled February 2026 — for discussion purposes, not financial advice*

---

## The Thesis in Brief

The "SaaSpocalypse" reflects a structural shift: AI agents are replacing traditional per-seat software, and the value is migrating from the application layer down to the infrastructure that powers those agents — chips, data centers, and electricity. Goldman Sachs estimates $527 billion in global AI-related data center capex for 2026 alone, and the industry's compute capacity is growing at roughly 3x per year. Inference workloads — the compute consumed every time an AI agent performs a task — are expected to account for two-thirds of total AI compute demand by 2026, and unlike training, inference scales continuously with usage. The more agents that replace software seats, the more inference runs 24/7.

This rundown organizes ETFs and index funds into priority tiers based on how directly they capture this thesis, starting with the highest-conviction plays and working down to longer-term, lower-priority positions.

## TIER 1 — SEMICONDUCTORS & COMPUTE (Highest Priority)

**Why this matters most:** Every AI agent runs on chips. The compute buildout is already happening and accelerating, backed by hundreds of billions in committed capital spending from hyperscalers. This is the most direct, liquid, and well-established way to bet on AI infrastructure.

- **SMH** (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) — The flagship semiconductor ETF and probably the single most popular way to get concentrated AI compute exposure. Tracks the top 25 semiconductor companies across the full value chain: GPU designers, foundries, memory, and equipment makers. Top holdings are Nvidia, TSMC, Broadcom, Micron, and AMD, with the top 10 making up over 73% of assets. Annualized returns of roughly 30.9% over the past decade. Trades at about 33x trailing earnings. Expense ratio: 0.35%.

- **SOXX** (iShares Semiconductor ETF) — The main alternative to SMH. Very similar concept, tracks the PHLX Semiconductor index. Slightly more equally weighted across holdings than SMH, so a bit less top-heavy. Similar long-term performance profile. Often discussed as interchangeable with SMH — the choice between them is more about subtle weighting preferences than fundamentally different bets. Expense ratio: 0.35%.

- **SOXQ** (Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF) — Tracks the same PHLX index as SOXX but with a meaningfully lower expense ratio (0.19%). Surged 64% over the past year with 15% year-to-date gains as of early 2026. About $1 billion in assets, so less liquid than SMH or SOXX but perfectly fine for buy-and-hold investing. Worth considering as a cheaper way to get essentially the same exposure as SOXX.

- **PSI** (Invesco Semiconductors ETF) — More concentrated and specialized than the above options. Only 30 holdings, focused specifically on equipment manufacturers and memory chips rather than the full semiconductor spectrum. Surged 45% over the past year. This is a more targeted bet on the physical buildout itself — the companies making the machines that make the chips. Higher risk, higher potential reward if infrastructure spending accelerates. Expense ratio: 0.56%.

- **CHPX** (Global X AI Semiconductor & Quantum ETF) — Newer, more niche fund targeting AI-specific semiconductor and quantum computing companies. Smaller and less liquid than SMH or SOXX. Interesting if you want to tilt specifically toward AI-optimized chip applications rather than the broad semiconductor cycle, but the smaller fund size means less track record to evaluate. Expense ratio: 0.50%.

## TIER 2 — POWER & ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE (High Priority)

**Why this is the next most important layer:** AI data centers consume enormous amounts of electricity, and the grid isn't ready. U.S. electricity demand is projected to hit all-time highs in 2025 and 2026, breaking nearly two decades of flat demand. Data center power demand is forecast to reach 106 gigawatts by 2035, a figure that keeps getting revised upward. Power is widely considered the most underpriced bottleneck in the AI supply chain. As investors rotate away from software, they're rotating into hardware and power.

- **IPWR** (iShares U.S. Power Infrastructure ETF) — The broadest and most direct play on the AI power bottleneck. Not a traditional defensive utility fund — it holds higher-growth power infrastructure firms focused on grid modernization and expansion. About 35% in electric utilities, 18% in electric components. Top names include GE Vernova and NextEra Energy. Up 6% year-to-date in early 2026, outperforming both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. This is probably the cleanest single-ETF expression of "AI needs electricity and the grid needs upgrading." Expense ratio: 0.40%.

- **NLR** (VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF) — Holds both uranium producers (Cameco, Denison Mines) and utilities that operate nuclear plants. The nuclear thesis is strong long-term: Microsoft signed a 20-year, $1.6 billion deal with Constellation Energy to restart Three Mile Island for data center power, Amazon partnered with Talen Energy for 1,920 megawatts of nuclear power through 2042, and the U.S. Department of Energy awarded $2.7 billion in January 2026 to strengthen domestic uranium enrichment. The caveat: new small modular reactors likely won't come online until the 2030s, so this is a longer-duration bet. Near-term gains come from existing nuclear plant operators and uranium miners benefiting from rising demand. Expense ratio: 0.56%.

- **TNUK** (Tortoise Nuclear Renaissance ETF) — Newer, more targeted nuclear play than NLR, focused specifically on the nuclear supply chain and renaissance narrative. Smaller fund with less track record. Expense ratio: 0.75%. Consider this a more concentrated alternative to NLR if you have high conviction on the nuclear thesis specifically.

- **ICLN** (iShares Global Clean Energy ETF) — Broader clean energy fund holding 102 stocks across solar, wind, and other renewables. Gained 46.6% in 2025 and is up over 10% year-to-date in 2026. The AI connection is real — tech companies are signing massive clean energy deals to power data centers — but ICLN is also sensitive to interest rates and energy policy in ways the other power plays are not. More of a dual-thesis bet (AI power demand plus clean energy transition) than a pure AI infrastructure play. Expense ratio: 0.40%.

## TIER 3 — DATA CENTER REITs & DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE (Medium Priority)

**Why this is a solid but slower-growth layer:** AI agents and models need physical homes. The companies that own and lease data center space collect rent from the hyperscalers on long-term contracts. These are strong, cash-flowing businesses with structural tailwinds, but because they're structured as REITs, they're designed for steady income and moderate growth rather than rapid appreciation. They're the "sleep well at night" part of the AI infrastructure thesis.

- **DTCR** (Global X Data Center & Digital Infrastructure ETF) — The most focused data center infrastructure ETF. About 41% in data center REITs, 27% in semiconductors, 17% in IT services. Avoids megacap software exposure and focuses on companies generating revenue from leasing physical space and power. Top holdings include Equinix and Digital Realty Trust. The logic is straightforward: when hyperscalers spend hundreds of billions on data centers, the REITs in this fund collect the rent. Smaller fund (~$125M in assets), so less liquid than the semiconductor ETFs. Yields about 1.3% in dividends. Expense ratio: 0.50%.

- **IDGT** (iShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF) — BlackRock's version of the same concept. Targets U.S. companies involved in storing, processing, and transmitting digital data. Similar concept to DTCR with the backing of a larger, more established fund family.

## TIER 4 — BROAD MARKET & TECH INDEX ETFs (Core / Foundation)

**Why these belong in the mix:** These provide diversified exposure to the overall tech ecosystem and broader economy. They won't appreciate as fast as concentrated semiconductor bets if the AI thesis plays out perfectly, but they protect you if the thesis is directionally right but the exact sub-sector winners shift. They also capture the indirect beneficiaries of AI — companies whose productivity improves because of AI even if they're not building the infrastructure.

- **QQQM** (Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF) — Tracks the Nasdaq-100. Heavy Magnificent Seven weighting gives natural AI exposure. This is the cheaper, buy-and-hold version of QQQ — same exact holdings, lower expense ratio (0.15% vs 0.20%). The downside for the SaaSpocalypse thesis specifically: it also holds SaaS names like Salesforce, Adobe, and Workday that are being disrupted. So you're buying some of the winners and some of the losers in the same basket. Still, if AI lifts the largest tech companies overall, QQQM benefits.

- **QQQ** (Invesco QQQ Trust) — Same Nasdaq-100 as QQQM but with higher liquidity and a robust options market. Only preferable to QQQM if you're actively trading or using options strategies. For buy-and-hold, QQQM saves you money for identical exposure. Expense ratio: 0.20%.

- **VOO** (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) — Broadest U.S. large-cap exposure. Includes tech but also financials, healthcare, industrials, energy — sectors that benefit from AI's economic ripple effects. Very low expense ratio at 0.03%. The most diversified option that still captures AI upside through its large tech weighting.

- **SPY** (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) — Same S&P 500 as VOO. More liquid and has more options activity, but higher expense ratio (0.09%). Like QQQ vs QQQM — SPY is for active traders, VOO is for buy-and-hold investors.

- **VTI** (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF) — The broadest option on this entire list. Includes large, mid, and small-cap U.S. stocks. The most diversified, lowest-conviction AI play, but also the most resilient if things don't go exactly as planned. Expense ratio: 0.03%.

- **VGT** (Vanguard Information Technology ETF) — Pure technology sector fund. More tech-concentrated than QQQM but less targeted than SMH. Very low expense ratio (0.10%). Holds both AI infrastructure winners and application-layer companies.

- **FTEC** (Fidelity MSCI Information Technology ETF) — Nearly identical to VGT with an even lower expense ratio (0.084%). If you're a Fidelity customer, this is the most cost-efficient way to get broad tech sector exposure.

## TIER 5 — BIOTECH & PHARMA (Lowest Priority — Longer-Term Play)

**Why this is last but still worth knowing about:** AI is beginning to accelerate drug discovery, compress clinical timelines, and improve R&D efficiency across the pharmaceutical industry. Dario Amodei has specifically predicted that AI will dramatically speed up the discovery of new drugs and that the FDA approval pipeline will become the bottleneck rather than the science. However, this is a longer-duration bet than compute or power infrastructure — the breakthrough-level impact is more of a 3-5+ year story, and biotech is inherently volatile due to binary events like trial results and regulatory approvals. Consider this a future addition once core positions are established.

- **XLV** (Health Care Select Sector SPDR) — The safest entry point into healthcare. About 60 holdings across pharma, biotech, medical devices, and services. Top holdings include Eli Lilly (~15%), Johnson & Johnson (~9%), and AbbVie (~7%) — all of which are actively partnering with AI companies. Eli Lilly and Nvidia recently announced a $1 billion AI co-innovation lab for drug discovery. Very low expense ratio at 0.08%. This is healthcare with AI as a tailwind, not a pure AI-biotech bet.

- **VHT** (Vanguard Health Care ETF) — Broader than XLV with about 398 holdings. More diversified across mid-cap healthcare names. Expense ratio: 0.09%. A gentler way to get healthcare exposure without heavy concentration in the top few mega-caps.

- **IBB** (iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF) — The flagship biotech ETF. Mix of large-cap biotech (Amgen, Gilead, Regeneron, Vertex) and smaller innovative names. More volatile than XLV or VHT but more directly exposed to AI-accelerated drug discovery upside. This is where you'd look if you wanted to make biotech a more meaningful part of the portfolio down the road.

- **XBI** (SPDR S&P Biotech ETF) — The aggressive alternative to IBB. Equal-weighted, so smaller and earlier-stage biotech companies have outsized influence. If AI drug discovery disproportionately benefits smaller, more innovative companies, XBI captures more of that upside. Significantly more volatile — this is the highest-risk option in the biotech tier.

- **BBH** (VanEck Biotech ETF) — Concentrated fund tracking just the 25 largest biotech companies. VanEck markets it as positioned for the AI revolution in healthcare, with holdings including companies actively using AI for molecular modeling and gene-editing therapies. More concentrated means more conviction required. Expense ratio: 0.35%.

- **ARKG** (ARK Genomic Revolution ETF) — Cathie Wood's genomics fund. Holds pure-play AI drug discovery companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals alongside gene-editing firms like CRISPR Therapeutics. The highest-risk, highest-conviction play on AI transforming biological science. ARK funds are controversial and highly volatile. Only for money you're comfortable seeing swing dramatically. Expense ratio: 0.75%.

## ETFs TO AVOID (Given This Thesis)

- **IGV** (iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF) — Pure SaaS basket. Down ~25% year-to-date. If the SaaSpocalypse thesis is correct, this holds the companies being disrupted.

- **CLOU** (Global X Cloud Computing ETF) — Heavy SaaS exposure. Same structural headwind as IGV.

- **SOXL** (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x) — Leveraged ETF that triples daily semiconductor moves. Daily rebalancing creates decay over time that erodes returns even if the underlying goes up, as long as the path is volatile. These are trading instruments, not investment vehicles. Not appropriate for buy-and-hold over months or years.

## Practical Notes

**On overlap:** SMH and QQQM share many of the same top holdings (Nvidia, Broadcom, etc.). Owning both is less diversified than it appears on paper. Be aware of this when deciding allocation ratios.

**On expense ratios:** Over a multi-year holding period, expense ratios matter. Where two funds offer essentially the same exposure (QQQ vs QQQM, VOO vs SPY, SOXX vs SOXQ, VGT vs FTEC), the cheaper option saves real money over time.

**On tax efficiency:** If any of these holdings go into tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, Roth IRA), put the highest-growth-potential funds there so gains compound tax-free or tax-deferred. The highest-growth candidates on this list are likely in Tiers 1 and 2.

**On the "avoid" list:** IGV and CLOU are listed as avoids given this specific thesis. If you believe some traditional SaaS companies will successfully pivot to outcome-based AI pricing, there could be selective value in the wreckage — but that requires company-by-company analysis, not a broad ETF bet.
